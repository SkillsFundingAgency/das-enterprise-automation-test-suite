Feature: RE_CUA_05


@ignore
#We have recently come-up with a temporary workaround for creating the accounts for manual and automation purposes.
#Along with that, the Registrations module has moved into BAU phase and not having any frequent updates, the work around we have is kind of providing what we need.
#On that basis, I think this task can be put on hold until the circumstance changes.
